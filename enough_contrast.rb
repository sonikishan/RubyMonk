# Problem Statement

# For 2 Colors in RGB:
# (R1, G1, B1) and (R2, G2, B2),

# Brightness index is:
# ( 299*R1 + 587*G1 + 114*B1) / 1000

# Brightness difference is:
# Absolute difference in brighness indices

# Hue difference is:
# |R1 - R2| + |G1 - G2| + |B1 - B2|
# where |x| is the absolute value of x

# If Brightness difference is more than 125 and the Hue difference is more than 500 then the colors have sufficient contrast

# Find out if the given color combos have sufficient contrast and get all the tests passing.
